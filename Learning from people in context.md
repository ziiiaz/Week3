> :one: **The Main Activity of The Project**
  
After the heuristic evaluations and testing of the website, it was time to see how users engage with the website and interact with different pages. Like the Usability Testing phase, users will be occupied with a particular activity such as browsing and filling forms to accomplish a task and gratify one’s need. Unlike Usability Testing, we are going to document users’ activity in the context. We are trying to observe users not merely as an entity that is not detached from the design; instead, the product is intentionally designed for them. I will elaborate on this part in the last section, Reflection. 
Racial profiling at U.S. airports is not a new issue, and it has increased since 9/11. Based on the [report]( https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-120_Mar14.pdf) that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released, they spend over $150 million on security scanning devices around the states to reduce the flight risk, especially after the 9/11 attack. However, as [Vox]( https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/17/18412450/tsa-airport-full-body-scanners-racist) and [ProPublica’s]( https://www.propublica.org/article/tsa-not-discriminating-against-black-women-but-their-body-scanners-might-be?utm_content=buffer9d49d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer) show, TSA officers have primarily targeted people of color and people with hijab and turban. As ProPublica’s report says, in this category, women are on top of the list. While DHS halted its  [Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques]( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Transportation%20Security%20Administration%20%28TSA%29%20-%20Scientific%20Substantiation%20of%20Behavioral%20Indicators.pdf) ($25 million funds), based on their conclusion in November 2013 on failure of the program, TSA screening devices are still facilitating the racial profiling at the airports. DHS and TSA blame the way screening machines were designed, not their officers. These machines are sensitive toward thick hairs (braided), turban, and hijabs, recognize them as an unknown objects. As a result, these people potentially go to the further screening test, or officers might pat them down or ask them to unveil their hijab. United States Government Accountability Office (GOA) (reported)[https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-357.pdf] that how these machines failed in certain circumstances (mentioned earlier) and asked to consider the matter before deploying the next generation of these machines. For those who are regularly targeted by these machines and have to go through further screening, airports would become a spatiotemporal phenomenon that stimulates their memory of those distressing events. 
Considering this disrupting experience of those whom TSA has racially profiled, the main activity is as follows. The user search in the DHS (website)[www.dhs.gov] to find the travel complaint form and fill it with through their tablet device. Although one of the goals is to make the website’s design accessible for the user, it is crucial to consider target users’ experience with TSA in airports and if they are willing to file a complaint. The interview wants to document how users’ distressful experience would affect the usability of the website.  
  
> :two: **The Basic Needs Involved**
  
We want to ensure that if the user can easily file a complaint against TSA profiling during the screening procedure and, in case of hesitancy, what does cause it and why. If hesitancy is the result, how we can find resolve it with an innovative design.
  
> :three: **Common Way(s) Gratify Needs** 
  
Since there is no in-person, in-location solution, the user has to google keywords, find the webpage, and file a complaint. 

> :four: **Limitation(s) Expected to Be Improved**
  
We categorize the limitations into two groups: sociocultural and design-based matter. While we cannot change TSA’s internal regulations and improve screening machines, we can implement results of other studies on individuals’ experience with TSA in our design in a subtle way, at least to lift users’ hesitancy in filing a complaint. If the hesitancy arises from the feeling that there is nothing wrong with TSA screening machines or officers—although we demonstrate that this assumption is rejected even by the DHS— the UX Design team should develop a way to append DHS, GOA, and other private reports. These reports demonstrate how TSA programs (for example, SPOT) or machines ( [here](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-357.pdf) ) were not correct in their intuitions (like trained officers in SPOT program) or in detecting an unknown object in people’s hair or under their headdress. Addressing the issue by DHS and TSA in a clear way that all the website visitors can identify would send a message to the users, especially those targeted by these failures, that we are aware of the issue, and we are trying to resolve them. It would convey a positively different message to users. As we see in the interview, the user does not think reporting the incident would even be read by DHS or TSA. She even believes that what they did was for the airport’s security, and if the officer was not well trained, TSA would not let them be there. We will discuss the interview in the Reflection section.
