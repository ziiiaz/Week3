# :pencil: Research Goal and Requirements
  
> :one: **The Main Activity of The Project**
  
After the heuristic evaluations and testing of the website, it was time to see how users engage with the website and interact with different pages. Like the Usability Testing phase, users will be occupied with a particular activity such as browsing and filling forms to accomplish a task and gratify one’s need. Unlike Usability Testing, we are going to document users’ activity in the context. We are trying to observe users not merely as an entity that is not detached from the design; instead, the product is intentionally designed for them. I will elaborate on this part in the last section, Reflection. 
Racial profiling at U.S. airports is not a new issue, and it has increased since 9/11. Based on the [report]( https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-120_Mar14.pdf) that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released, they spend over $150 million on security scanning devices around the states to reduce the flight risk, especially after the 9/11 attack. However, as [Vox]( https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/17/18412450/tsa-airport-full-body-scanners-racist) and [ProPublica’s]( https://www.propublica.org/article/tsa-not-discriminating-against-black-women-but-their-body-scanners-might-be?utm_content=buffer9d49d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer) show, TSA officers have primarily targeted people of color and people with hijab and turban. As ProPublica’s report says, in this category, women are on top of the list. While DHS halted its  [Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques]( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Transportation%20Security%20Administration%20%28TSA%29%20-%20Scientific%20Substantiation%20of%20Behavioral%20Indicators.pdf) ($25 million funds), based on their conclusion in November 2013 on failure of the program, TSA screening devices are still facilitating the racial profiling at the airports. DHS and TSA blame the way screening machines were designed, not their officers. These machines are sensitive toward thick hairs (braided), turban, and hijabs, recognize them as an unknown objects. As a result, these people potentially go to the further screening test, or officers might pat them down or ask them to unveil their hijab. United States Government Accountability Office (GOA) (reported)[https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-357.pdf] that how these machines failed in certain circumstances (mentioned earlier) and asked to consider the matter before deploying the next generation of these machines. For those who are regularly targeted by these machines and have to go through further screening, airports would become a spatiotemporal phenomenon that stimulates their memory of those distressing events. 
Considering this disrupting experience of those whom TSA has racially profiled, the main activity is as follows. The user search in the DHS (website)[www.dhs.gov] to find the travel complaint form and fill it with through their tablet device. Although one of the goals is to make the website’s design accessible for the user, it is crucial to consider target users’ experience with TSA in airports and if they are willing to file a complaint. The interview wants to document how users’ distressful experience would affect the usability of the website.  
  
> :two: **The Basic Needs Involved**
  
We want to ensure that if the user can easily file a complaint against TSA profiling during the screening procedure and, in case of hesitancy, what does cause it and why. If hesitancy is the result, how we can find resolve it with an innovative design.
  
> :three: **Common Way(s) Gratify Needs** 
  
Since there is no in-person, in-location solution, the user has to google keywords, find the webpage, and file a complaint. 

> :four: **Limitation(s) Expected to Be Improved**
  
We categorize the limitations into two groups: sociocultural and design-based matter. While we cannot change TSA’s internal regulations and improve screening machines, we can implement results of other studies on individuals’ experience with TSA in our design in a subtle way, at least to lift users’ hesitancy in filing a complaint. If the hesitancy arises from the feeling that there is nothing wrong with TSA screening machines or officers—although we demonstrate that this assumption is rejected even by the DHS— the UX Design team should develop a way to append DHS, GOA, and other private reports. These reports demonstrate how TSA programs (for example, SPOT) or machines ( [here](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-357.pdf) ) were not correct in their intuitions (like trained officers in SPOT program) or in detecting an unknown object in people’s hair or under their headdress. Addressing the issue by DHS and TSA in a clear way that all the website visitors can identify would send a message to the users, especially those targeted by these failures, that we are aware of the issue, and we are trying to resolve them. It would convey a positively different message to users. As we see in the interview, the user does not think reporting the incident would even be read by DHS or TSA. She even believes that what they did was for the airport’s security, and if the officer was not well trained, TSA would not let them be there. We will discuss the interview in the Reflection section.

  # 🏡 Target Users 
  
 > :one: **User's Characteristics**(demographics|preference|expertise|mainstram or not)
  
  The user that we talked to was a young lady in her 30s, finishing a master’s program in computer science and very social. She moved to the U.S. more than three years ago from the Middle East. She respects older adults and believes their experiences are always valuable. She likes to have a minimalistic life without being surrounded by things that do not bring meaning into her life. She uses her electronic devices on a timely schedule. For example, she does not browse social media for over 10 minutes or spend more than an hour on Netflix in a week. Instead, she reads articles and mostly focuses on her education. For the past few months, she has spent most of her day in the library.
  
  > :two: **Context of Use**
  
  While she knew about the DHS and TSA website, she was not aware of filing a complaint. She believed that even if we can file one against Google, the DHS and TSA are placed outside and beyond this: untouchables. 
  
  > :three: **Processes for Completion of Activity**
  
She quickly found the webpage through carefully reading the content and looking at tabs. She then touched the How Do I tab, read the content under For Travelers, and tabbed on it. On that page, she immediately found File a Travel Complaint (DHS TRIP), tabbed on it, which directs her to the next page. She opened Start Here, then touched File your complaint online. When the page loaded, she looked at it for a few seconds (which we interpret as a sign of hesitancy), then she said she wouldn’t proceed. She does not believe she has the right to complain, TSA officers did (do) wrong as they are well trained, and the DHS will never pay attention to these documents.

  # 🔎 Research Method
  
  > :one: **Hows**
  
I conducted a semi-structured interview, designed to be flexible with a sudden shift, which I call a rhizomatic interview. That is, if participants of an interview suddenly decide to shift from the topic of the question, the interviewers do not push the flow of speech to their idealistic frame of the question, but they let it (the shift) grow like a rhizome. For example, when the user suddenly told me that she would not fill the form, the interview went in an unexpected direction, revealing a weakness in the design: why a racially profiled user might not file a complaint. 
Being immersed in the users’ lives and seeing the subject matter in context is recommended by UX designers and researchers (IDEO.org 2015: 51). It gives more in-depth knowledge about users’ lives, how they do not do certain activities, and why they do not. IDEO suggests shadowing a user for a day (51) and recommending researchers ask the user about their life and decision-making strategies. Documenting these types of information in a day or week for a researcher is ideal. With seven years of fieldwork experience, I believe a day of shadowing does not go somewhere close to immersion, as IDEO defines or describes it. In our case, for example, the user was probably not going to share the distressing experience in the airport if the interviewer (I) was not familiar with her life, believes, culture and values, among other things. The user described how a man officer asked her to take off her jacket. The user did not elaborate on it since a cultural factor like shame filtered out the detailed description of the feeling. While the user was familiar with the interviewer, she did not verbalize her feeling during the interview. However, after the interview, she told me she could not tell everything in front of the camera like she felt naked when the TSA officer asked her to take off her jacket while wearing a t-shirt under it. That is to say, even familiarity with the user does not guarantee to document minute but crucial details of the user’s life.  
 
  > :two: **Whats**
  
It was necessary to have the interview recorded. The user was unsure why she should be recorded while I explained to her before we initiated the session. I assure her to blur her face and remove all identifiable information. After all, she was not comfortable describing the incident with all details. I decided not to take notes while talking, as I believe it could further the existing distance and differences between her and me as the interviewer. Therefore, I avoided taking notes during the interview and tried to keep it as a natural, spontaneous form of communication. Moreover, the interview was conducted where the user feels comfortable and usually relaxes after working. The intention behind this was to reduce the formality of the interview.

  # :mortar_board: Reflection 
  
  When researchers formulate questions or hypotheses for their study, they are already looking at the examination subjects from a set of theories and methodological frameworks. Even if they do not wholly proceed with those theories and frameworks, they are still positioned and have a partial vision of the subject of their study. Researchers must know where they are coming from and how they are analyzing data. In other words, for researchers, positionality is a self-reflection approach to know how their position toward a phenomenon would affect the ways of conducting the research, the conclusion, and the results. While it is ideal for researchers to be detached from their theories and frameworks and at the same time to see the world from their subject of studies (for example, users of the DHS website in this case), it is probably difficult for them to be separated from the sociocultural and political views that sometimes are ascribed during a lifetime. In the case of the TSA screening machine, the research team might have ignored the fact that not everyone in the U.S. and the world has thin unbraided hair or some people cover their head. This failure could be an example of how researchers’ positionality could affect the whole processes of research, from questions and theoretical stage to the conclusions (product) and the result (racially profiled users). Being reflective of researchers’ own positions would at least generate awareness of some potential pitfalls in the whole process of conducting research. 
Inspired by a line of scholars in anthropology, I believe Dell Hymes's concept of “voice” is relevant in conducting fieldwork for UX designers and researchers. In contrast to Chomsky’s linguistic competency (1965) considers it as an ability that is homogeneously distributed among speakers, Hymes (1937), based on his ethnographic research, argued that the communicative competency is not essentially uniform and shared by all individuals in a language community. The point which I want to emphasize here is Hymes's distinction between two reasons for not saying something. First, it is possible that individuals do not say something due to the time and space in which they are, and second, they do not say it because there is no way to express it. 
The first distinction between homogeneous linguistic competency and heterogeneous can help researchers know their subjects better before immersing in the field. If researchers think of a homogeneous target users’ community, they might lose the difference between the individuals. While it is not feasible to consider all the differences, being aware of them could help researchers to design their study differently. The second point from Hymsean's notion of voice is that no matter how much researchers detach themselves from their theories and methods, they might not get a genuine response from their users due to the two reasons of not saying something mentioned above. In our case, when the user was describing how she goes to the airport step by step, at (10:26), she skipped the TSA procedure “I am I just like get a cup of coffee, spend some time like buying souvenirs or something for friends and that’s it.” When the interviewer asked about the TSA screening process, she provided more details, but she noted that “screening is always unpleasant experience” (11:28) 
The last point is about how the user thought the way TSA dealt with her situation could be justified in favor of officers' formal training and the security for the whole. She had no problem: 
>Me  26:43  
>So you think that is, it’s you would like sacrifice your feelings, your experience. 

>Interviewee  26:48  
>Exactly, exactly, 

>Me  26:50  
>in favor of having the security, 

>Interviewee  26:53  
>yes. 

>Me  26:54  
>So you think that they are doing well even if they are hurting you. This is

>Interviewee  26:58  
>just one. I mean this is his like, I think this is the, the, I don’t know the policy the rule I don’t know what should I call it that, so they, they, they learned, or they yeah they learned and there are trainings I don’t know when they got hired, they have something they have like a procedure Yeah, something to follow. Yeah, so it’s part of the, of their like job. 

It is about the security and the fact that the officer does not understand her cultural background. Therefore, it would be futile to talk to the officer at that moment:

>Interviewee  15:59  
>I didn’t explain because it was about religion

>I didn’t. 

>Me  16:03  
>but would you told me, surely that. Oh, yes. All right, yeah. Yeah, 

>Interviewee  16:07  
>especially with that there was a lineup and he was like really insisting and very like asking for it, repeated many times, so I couldn’t like argue with.

We can see how this failure in understanding constructs a hierarchy of knowledge and a wide gap between the user and the officer, which is reflected in the last few minutes of the interview when she opened the page to file a complaint but said, “It’s for the same reason that I won't file a complaint” (26:05). Why is this important for us? An answer could be the experience the user had in the airport, and since the DHS website is related to TSA and its officers, it is worthless to file a complaint, as she says “I mean we would file a complaint against at&t for example, Google Ralphs for any reason the airlines but not the TSA”(20:15). Why does she believes DHS and TSA do not care about complaints? Because she cannot see the result of the complaints on the website. For example, she says,“the experience would maybe make me think about filing your complaint, knowing that they gonna like, review the complaint, take it into consideration”(30:14). In the end, she tells us what would change her mind about filing a complaint that if the website was more racially and religiously inclusive, she could feel better about filing a complaint which is what the design team failed to notice:
  >I just, I’m just, I always ask myself, actually, if the, the TSA officers are open to learn about other cultures and backgrounds of travelers to the US, especially that’s, I mean here people are like, all they have different backgrounds, different cultures, even Americans, not just like residents or visitors to the country. Maybe they is good to have. I don’t know, and trainings or like awareness in the airports, about, like, the different cultures and backgrounds, just like what happens in the universities now if you go to any university website, you and you look at the banner, and the front page you see a picture of students from different backgrounds …some of them wearing a hijab covering their head, others are not with a cover different skin color, different like facial everything. It shows that the diversity in this country. Yeah, and they are accepting people the way they are in the government setting (31:14).
